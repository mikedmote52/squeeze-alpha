# 📱 Mobile Access Guide - AI Trading System

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
Your AI trading system runs locally on your home computer, but you need to access it from work/mobile.

## 🔧 **Immediate Solutions**

### **Option 1: Try External IP (Quickest)**
From your phone, try:
```
http://184.23.244.213:8501
```

If this doesn't work, your router is blocking external access.

### **Option 2: Router Port Forwarding**
1. **Access your router** (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`)
2. **Login** with admin credentials
3. **Find "Port Forwarding"** or "NAT" section
4. **Add these rules:**
   - External Port: `8501` → Internal IP: `192.168.7.53` → Internal Port: `8501`
   - External Port: `8000` → Internal IP: `192.168.7.53` → Internal Port: `8000`
5. **Save and restart router**

### **Option 3: VPN Access**
- Set up VPN to your home network
- Use: `http://192.168.7.53:8501`

### **Option 4: Cloud Deployment** (Best)
Deploy to Streamlit Cloud for permanent mobile access.

## 🎯 **Recommended: Cloud Deployment**

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Access from anywhere
- ✅ No router configuration needed
- ✅ Always available
- ✅ Professional URL

### **Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
3. Get permanent URL like: `https://your-trading-system.streamlit.app`

## 📞 **Emergency Access**

If you need immediate access to your portfolio:
1. **Call/text someone at home** to check the system
2. **Use Alpaca mobile app** for basic portfolio viewing
3. **Check Slack notifications** for system alerts

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

⚠️ **Warning**: Opening ports to the internet exposes your system to risks.
