2. **Shows empty results** when real data unavailable
3. **Does not modify existing files** - only adds new functionality
4. **Uses separate directory structure** to avoid conflicts

- Real-time opportunity scanning
- Growth score calculation (0-100)
- Position size optimization
- Risk management (25% max position, 5% max loss)
- Technical analysis integration
- Performance tracking

## 🛡️ Data Sources

- **Market Data**: Real Alpaca API, Polygon
- **Portfolio Data**: Real brokerage connections
- **NO MOCK DATA**: System fails gracefully without real data
