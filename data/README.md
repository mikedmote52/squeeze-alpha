# Data Directory

This directory stores system performance tracking data:

- `system_recommendations.json` - All recommendations from both Alpha and Catalyst engines
- `system_performance.json` - Performance metrics and comparison data

The tracking system automatically creates these files as recommendations are made and tracked.
